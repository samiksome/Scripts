# A Collection of Small Python Scripts

This is simply a collection of scripts to make my life easier. Nearly every script has a different purpose and each of them are documented separately.

These scripts have been tested with Python 3, and although they should work with Python 2, there may be some bugs.

    Crop an image in an intelligent manner using gradients to locate the most important region in the image.
